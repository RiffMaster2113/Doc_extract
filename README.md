# Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): A Practical Implementation 🤖

## Project Overview 📋
This B.Tech final year project explores the implementation and practical applications of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python. The project leverages [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) to demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be enhanced with external knowledge retrieval capabilities.

## Background 📚
Large Language Models have revolutionized natural language processing, but they face challenges with knowledge cutoffs and hallucinations. RAG addresses these limitations by augmenting LLM responses with relevant information retrieved from external document collections, enabling:
- Real-time access to updated information
- Verifiable responses with source attribution
- Reduced hallucinations through grounded context
- Domain-specific knowledge integration

I've structured this README to be more academic and professional while maintaining clear instructions and educational value. It now reads like a proper engineering project documentation with technical depth and future considerations. You can copy this markdown directly and use it in your project.
